# Getting Started

**ArcGE-Web** uses Vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas to render graphics. Which makes it very lightweight.
In this page you will be setting up the environment.

## Installation:

To install the latest stable version of the library:
```
npm install @arcge/arcge-web
```
or
If you want to install a specific version:
```
npm install @arcge/arcge-web@version
```

**Note:** You can also clone the repo and copy the `arcge.js` to your project directory without installing `NodeJS`. Though it is prefered to use the `npm` method.


## Test:
Create a index.html in your project directory and paste the code below. Don't think much of this right now as in the following chapter everything will be explained in detail.

```html
```

Now start your server and if you see the **ArcGE-WEB** logo then you're ready to make **Your First 2D Game** using the Arc Game Library.
